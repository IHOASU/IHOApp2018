Researched about what a Droplet in a Digital Ocean is. Understood how to operate configure and operate a droplet. The services in a droplet are active only when currently logged in. Researched ways on how to keep services active by pushing them to background process status. The droplet that is being used here in this project is an Ubuntu Virtual machine that is hosted in the Digital Ocean cloud.

Currently, IHO is paying $20 per month for the droplet that is being for hosting the database. A suitable alternative will be explored in the next sprint since currently, our main goal is to kick start this project after rectifying the errors. Currently, I am researching about nginx web server. We need a light weight web server for this project and so need to see how nginx stacks up against apache web server.
